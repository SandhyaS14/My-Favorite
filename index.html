        <p class="paragraph"> Playing the violin is my favorite hobby. In fact, it has many benefits. 
            One is, it helps calm our mind down. This in result lets us do what we're doing faster. 
            Another benefit is in the way we hold the violin. May we hold in on our shoulder or put it
             on our ankle, the pressure activates the nerves across the whole body and has some other
              benefits. A violin is normally made out of wood. It is because wood lets the sound from 
              the strings vibrate inside and come out faster and more beautifully than other materials. 
              The violin is the smallest instrument in the strings family including harp ang guitar. 
              It is small and light for me to hold it to play and its sound is high pitched and has 
              a high sound due to its small size and I like loud sounds.</p>
