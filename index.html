        <p class="paragraph"> Soccer is my favorite sport. This is because soccer mostly involves running. Running means going fast 
            and I normally like going fast. It feels like I am part of the wind and has a nice feeling to it. To contribute to that, 
            running also helps with health. It keeps calories under control and stops obesity. I don't want to get obesity at all so 
            it's a very good option. Soccer also helps with growing in height. I am only 4 feet and 7 inches so I need to grow more. 
            Another reason why I love soccer.

            No one knows exactly when soccer was created, but the earliest versions of the game can be traced back 3,000 years.
            Soccer is the most popular game in the world. In many countries it is known as “football”.
            In England, soccer was formed when several clubs formed the Football Association about 150 years ago.
            Women started playing soccer around the same time as men did in England. However, originally men were the main players in the game. Women’s soccer started to become extremely popular in the 1990s.
            In China, the first soccer balls were made from sewn clothing that was filled with rubble. In Europe during the Middle Ages, soccer balls were made from inflated pig bladders.
            Today most of the balls are made from layers of synthetic leather while the bladders inside the ball are made from latex or butyl.
            Some of the different shots in soccer are:
            The instep drive or knuckle shot
            The swerve shot
            The full volley
            The half volley
            The side volley
            The flying volley
            The maximum number of players on a soccer team is 11. The different positions are:
            Goalkeeper
            Centre-back
            Sweeper
            Fullback
            Wingback
            Centre-midfielder
            Defensive midfielder
            Attacking midfielder
            Winger
            Forward
            Striker
            Soccer is played on a grassy field called a pitch. The field is rectangular and must be between 100 and 130 yards long and 50 to 100 yards wide.
            An international soccer game is 90 minutes long. The 90 minutes is divided in two 45 minute halves.
