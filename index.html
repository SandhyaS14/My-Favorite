        <p class="paragraph"> Soccer is my favorite sport. This is because soccer mostly involves running. Running means going fast 
            and I normally like going fast. It feels like I am part of the wind and has a nice feeling to it. To contribute to that, 
            running also helps with health. It keeps calories under control and stops obesity. I don't want to get obesity at all so 
            it's a very good option.
